## Setup

Depending on your MySQL environment, you can do this using the
[phpMyAdmin](https://www.phpmyadmin.net/) GUI interface or via the command line.

### From command line:

1. Install MySQL and make sure it's running. On Ubuntu:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install mysql-server
   systemctl status mysql.service
   ```

2. Set up a MySQL database on your server. Current DB name of the database is
   `reaper93_associations`. Can be renamed.
   ```mysql
   DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS reaper93_associations;
   CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS reaper93_associations;
   ```

3. Create user and grant permissions to database. Current user name is
   `reaper93`. Can be renamed.
   ```mysql
   CREATE USER 'reaper93'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY ''; -- TODO clarify password
   GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON reaper93_associations.* TO 'reaper93'@'localhost' WITH GRANT OPTION;
   exit
   ```

4. Now, import the `.sql` file from the `map/database/db-export/` folder to your
   database. This will automatically create all necessary tables with some
   contents.
   ```bash
   mysql -ureaper93 --table reaper93_associations < map/database/db-export/reaper93_associations.sql
   ```

5. Verify the import. Login to the dbase:
   ```bash
   mysql -ureaper93 reaper93_associations
   ```
   Now in MySQL:
   ```mysql
   SHOW TABLES;
   SHOW COLUMNS activities_options;
   SHOW COLUMNS associations;
   SHOW COLUMNS contacts;
   SHOW COLUMNS districts_options;
   SHOW COLUMNS images;
   SHOW COLUMNS links;
   SHOW COLUMNS socialmedia;
   ```

### Using [phpMyAdmin](https://www.phpmyadmin.net/) GUI interface:
Click on the newly created database and select `Import` from the top menu. Then
you can upload the `.sql` file to your database.

1. In the `map/database/api` folder open `database.php`. Edit user name,
   database name and password according to (1.), (2.) and (3.) from the previous
   section.
2. Upload the `map/database/api` folder to a directory on your server.
3. In the file `map/app-<PART>/src/environments/environments.prod.ts` containing:
```typescript
export const environment = {
  production: true,
  ...
  phpApi: {
    serverBasePath: '/AssociationMap/api'
  }
  ...
};
```

6. Change the `serverBasePath` variable to the location on your server you
   uploaded the `map/database/api` folder to.
7. Build the angular app by executing `npm install` and `npm run-script
   build:prod` (defined in the `package.json`.)

For further information on how to install and setup angular as well as on how to
build an app, see here: [Angular Docs](https://angular.io/guide/setup-local)

8. The built app will appear inside the `map/app-<PART>/dist` folder. Upload the
   `map/app-<PART>/dist/AssociationMap` directory to a location on your server.

9. Open the app at
   `http(s)://[YOUR_SERVER]/[PATH_TO_CHOSEN_LOCATION]/AssociationMap`.

10. The edit form can be used at
    `http(s)://[YOUR_SERVER]/[PATH_TO_CHOSEN_LOCATION]/AssociationMap/form`.

11. The edit forms for the dropdown options can be used at
    `http(s)://[YOUR_SERVER]/[PATH_TO_CHOSEN_LOCATION]/AssociationMap/options-form`.
